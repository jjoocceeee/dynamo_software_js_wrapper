# Getting Started
Create an auth.json file in a folder called private in the root directory
The file structure should look like this
- dynamo_api
    - private
        - auth.json

In the auth.json file, add your api key and proxy address
```
{
    "api": "YOUR API KEY",
    "proxy": "YOUR PROXY ADDRESS"
}
```
